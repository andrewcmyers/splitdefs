splitdefs 1.1c
--------------

Splitdefs improves a build process by preventing unnecessary builds.
One of the annoyances of programming in C or C++ is that the natural
desire to organize preprocessor definitions into a central configuration
file leads to excessive rebuilding when the build process is driven
by make using automated dependency analysis. This is particularly true if
autoconf is being used for automatic configuration.

splitdefs helps avoid excessive rebuilding by automatically
splitting a header file into smaller headers and updating them
only when needed.  It is also easy to integrate into a build process.

Installation
------------

1. Run "configure" with an appropriate --exec-prefix option if you want to put the executable
   somewhere other than /usr/local

2. Do "make install"

3. If you prefer the (less capable) C implementation, you can do "make install_C".

System Requirements
-------------------

  * The C preprocessor cpp
  * ANSI C compiler (if you are building the C version)

Documentation
-------------

There is a man page (splitdefs.1). After installation, type "man splitdefs" to
see the documentation. Or you can run "nroff -man splitdefs.1" to see it before
installing.
