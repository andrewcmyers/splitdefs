splitdefs 1.1c
--------------

Splitdefs improves a build process by preventing unnecessary builds.
One of the annoyances of programming in C or C++ is that the natural
desire to organize preprocessor definitions into a central configuration
file leads to excessive rebuilding when the build process is driven
by make using automated dependency analysis. This is particularly true if
autoconf is being used for automatic configuration.

splitdefs helps avoid excessive rebuilding by automatically
splitting a header file into smaller headers and updating them
only when needed.  It is also easy to integrate into a build process.

Installation
------------

Run "configure", then "make". If all goes well, "make install".

System Requirements
